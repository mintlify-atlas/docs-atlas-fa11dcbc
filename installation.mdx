description: Prerequisites and setup instructions for building Electrobun apps
---

This guide covers everything you need to install and configure to build Electrobun apps.

## System requirements

Electrobun supports development on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The requirements vary by platform.

### macOS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Supported versions">
    **macOS 14+ (Sonoma or later)**

    Electrobun officially supports macOS 14 and later on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Xcode Command Line Tools">
    Required for compiling native components:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install CMake">
    Install via Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install cmake
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Windows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Supported versions">
    **Windows 11 or later**

    Electrobun officially supports Windows 11+. The x64 binary runs on both x64 and ARM Windows devices (ARM devices use automatic emulation).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Visual Studio Build Tools">
    Download and install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with C++ development tools, or install the full Visual Studio IDE with C++ workload.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install CMake">
    Download and install CMake from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Linux

<Steps>
  <Step title="Supported distributions">
    **Ubuntu 22.04+ (officially supported)**

    Other distributions with GTK3 and WebKit2GTK 4.1 support work but are community-supported.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install build tools and dependencies">
    On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config \
      libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
      libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
    ```

    <Note>
    These dependencies are required for building apps. Your users only need the runtime versions of these libraries, which are typically pre-installed on modern Linux distributions.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Install Bun

Electrobun uses Bun as its JavaScript runtime and package manager. You must have Bun installed on your development machine.

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

```powershell Windows
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```
</CodeGroup>

Verify the installation:

```bash
bun --version
```

<Tip>
Electrobun bundles a specific version of Bun with your app at build time, so your users don't need Bun installed.
</Tip>

## Install Node.js (optional)

While Electrobun uses Bun, some development tools and npm packages may require Node.js:

- Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- Or install via a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Platform-specific notes

### macOS: Code signing and notarization

If you plan to distribute your app to other macOS users:

- **Code signing**: Requires an Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- **Notarization**: Required for apps distributed outside the Mac App Store

Configure in `electrobun.config.ts`:

```typescript electrobun.config.ts
export default {
  // ...
  build: {
    mac: {
      codesign: true,
      notarize: true,
      entitlements: {
        "com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit": true,
        "com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory": true,
        "com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation": true,
      },
    },
  },
} satisfies ElectrobunConfig;
```

<Note>
The entitlements shown above are required for Electrobun apps with hardened runtime (required for notarization) due to Bun's JIT compilation.
</Note>

### Windows: WebView2

Electrobun uses Microsoft Edge WebView2 on Windows. It's included with Windows 11 by default, but you can configure your app to bundle it:

```typescript electrobun.config.ts
export default {
  // ...
  build: {
    win: {
      bundleCEF: false, // Use system WebView2 (recommended)
      // bundleCEF: true, // Bundle Chromium Embedded Framework (~70MB)
    },
  },
} satisfies ElectrobunConfig;
```

### Linux: System webview vs CEF

Linux apps can use the system WebKitGTK or bundle Chromium Embedded Framework:

```typescript electrobun.config.ts
export default {
  // ...
  build: {
    linux: {
      bundleCEF: false, // Use system WebKitGTK (~12MB app)
      // bundleCEF: true, // Bundle CEF (~60-80MB app)
    },
  },
} satisfies ElectrobunConfig;
```

<Warning>
When `bundleCEF: false`, users need WebKitGTK 4.1 installed. This is pre-installed on Ubuntu 22.04+ and most modern Linux distributions.
</Warning>

Electrobun uses a dual-binary approach on Linux:
- `libNativeWrapper.so` - GTK-only (~1.46MB)
- `libNativeWrapper_cef.so` - CEF-enabled (~3.47MB)

The CLI automatically selects the correct binary based on your `bundleCEF` setting.

## Architecture support

### macOS

Electrobun supports:
- **ARM64** (Apple Silicon: M1, M2, M3, M4)
- **x64** (Intel Macs)

Universal binaries are not yet supported. Build separately for each architecture.

### Windows

Electrobun builds target:
- **x64** (64-bit Intel/AMD)

ARM Windows devices run the x64 binary through Windows' automatic emulation layer.

### Linux

Electrobun supports:
- **x64** (64-bit Intel/AMD)
- **ARM64** (64-bit ARM, including Raspberry Pi 4+)

## Verify your installation

Create a test project to verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
npx electrobun init my-test-app
cd my-test-app
bun install
bun run dev
```

If a window opens with "Hello Electrobun!", you're all set!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="macOS: Command line tools not found">
    Install Xcode Command Line Tools:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    If already installed, reset the path:

    ```bash
    sudo xcode-select --reset
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windows: CMake not found">
    Make sure CMake is in your PATH. You may need to restart your terminal or computer after installing CMake.

    ```powershell
    cmake --version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Linux: Missing GTK or WebKit headers">
    Install development packages:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev

    For other distributions, search for equivalent packages:
    - **Fedora**: `gtk3-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel`
    - **Arch**: `gtk3 webkit2gtk-4.1`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied errors on Linux">
    Make sure your user has permission to install packages:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG sudo $USER
    ```

    Log out and back in for changes to take effect.
