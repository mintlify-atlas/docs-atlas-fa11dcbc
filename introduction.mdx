## What is Electrobun?

Electrobun is a complete **solution-in-a-box** for building, updating, and shipping ultra fast, tiny, and cross-platform desktop applications written in TypeScript. Under the hood it uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) to execute the main process and bundle webview TypeScript, with native bindings written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

## Why Electrobun?

  <Card title="Lightning fast" icon="bolt">
    Built on Bun's high-performance JavaScript runtime with native bindings in Zig for maximum speed

## Key features

### Write TypeScript everywhere

No webpack configuration, no babel setup, no transpiler complexity. Just write TypeScript for your main process and webviews, and Electrobun handles the rest.

```typescript src/bun/index.ts
import { BrowserWindow, Utils } from "electrobun/bun";

const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  title: "My App",
  url: "views://mainview/index.html",
  frame: { width: 1200, height: 800 },
});

mainWindow.on("close", () => {
  Utils.quit();
});
```

### Process isolation with typed RPC

Main and webview processes are isolated for security and stability. Communication happens through a fast, type-safe RPC system that's easy to implement.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Main process (Bun)
import { createRPC } from "electrobun/bun";

const rpc = createRPC(mainWindow, {
  requests: {
    getUserData: async () => {
      return { name: "Alice", id: 123 };
    },
  },
});
```

```typescript View process
import { createRPC } from "electrobun/view";

const rpc = createRPC();

const userData = await rpc.requests.getUserData();
console.log(userData); // { name: "Alice", id: 123 }
```
</CodeGroup>

### Native desktop APIs

Access native functionality through a clean, consistent API across all platforms:

- **Windows**: BrowserWindow, BrowserView, multiple windows
- **Menus**: Application menus, context menus, system tray
- **Dialogs**: File open/save, message boxes, notifications
- **System**: Global shortcuts, screen info, clipboard
- **Updates**: Automatic updates with binary diffing

### Small, self-extracting bundles

Electrobun apps are distributed as single executable files that self-extract and run:

- **~12MB** base size when using system webview
- **~60-80MB** when bundling Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)
- **14KB+** update patches using bsdiff binary diffing
- **No installer** required - just run the executable

## Platform support
